                    Education.[4] The Ministry of Primary and Mass Education implements policies for primary education
                    and
                    state-funded schools at a local level.[5] Education in Bangladesh is compulsory for all citizens
                    until
                    the end of grade eight.[6] Primary and secondary education is funded by the state and free of charge
                    in
                    public schools.[7]

                    Bangladesh conforms fully to the UN's Education For All (EFA) objectives[8] and the Millennium

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The Human Rights Measurement Initiative (HRMI)[12] finds that
                    Bangladesh
                    is fulfilling only 82.5% of what it should be fulfilling for the right to education based on the
                    country's level of income.[13] HRMI breaks down the right to education by looking at the rights to
                    both
                    primary education and secondary education. While taking into consideration Bangladesh's income
                    level,
                    the nation is achieving 88.7% of what should be possible based on its resources (income) for primary

                    decades,
                    Bangladesh has achieved commendable advancements in the domain of education. As education stands as
                    an
                    indispensable human right, dedicated efforts are being exerted to guarantee its accessibility for
                    every
                    individual. Looking ahead to the next decade, it is conceivable that Bangladesh will attain a full
                    literacy rate of 100 percent.[15]</p>
